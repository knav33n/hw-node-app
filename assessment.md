Please build a code deployment pipeline for the demo app given below.  Containerized cloud infrastructure is preferred. You may use GitHub Actions and terraform on Aws (ECS + Fargate) or your familiar infra stack. Please validate the code deployment pipeline by making a test change by committing or merging the changes to the main git branch and ensure the code changes are reflected in the target cloud environment. Please prepare a screencast of you doing the work when doing it and share the same with us.
